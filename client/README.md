# Watchlist Web client

This directory contains the client for Watchlist Web API. To run the client, you need `node` installed on your system.

## Installing

Run `npm install` in this directory to install all dependencies.

## Running

You need to have the API server running before starting the client, so that the client can fetch data from the API. See main [README](../README.md#running) for steps to run it.

Run `npm run dev` to run the dev server. The client app is then available in [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173)
