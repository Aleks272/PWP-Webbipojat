# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE:** 28.1.2025
* **ASSISTANTS:**

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*

Overall, the plan looks good and realistic. Improvements to wording of the text and diagram were discussed (these are included in action points below). The amount of resources (must be at least 5 according to [project requirements](https://lovelace.oulu.fi/ohjelmoitava-web/pwp-spring-2025/pwp-project-work-assignment/#restful-api)) for the API could end up being too low with the current description of users and lists. This should be taken into account in the implementation phase.

The process of adding movies and series to the database of the API was discussed. Using some external service here could be possible, from which the movies and series would be picked when adding a new entry to the user's list. However, this it not a mandatory feature.

### Action points
*List here the actions points discussed with assistants*
- Explain APIs reasoning more briefly, what it does, how it does it and why. aka motivation behind the project.
